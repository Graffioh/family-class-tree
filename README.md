# Family Class Tree project (Learning C++)

" Create a class called Person which will have a name, when they were born and when (and if) they died. Allow the user to create these Person classes and put them into a family tree structure. Print out the tree to the screen. "

Used a class to create the person object with name and dates. My first option was to create a family tree linked list,this mean that you could insert a person where you want + family heriarchy etc.
I had problems with implementing linked list with template classes cause no knowledge about this topic for now, I will implement that later.
So I decided to put the informations inside a vector called familyTree and then print it.

What to implement?
- Various controls about "correct" input (so for example in the name you can't put a number) (DONE)
- Add the possibility to insert a name with spaces (DONE)
- Make Linked list with template classes works with a simple printlist
- Family heriarchy by adding the node where you want
- Add a makefile
- ...
